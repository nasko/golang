/** Mission: Time to Jump **
***************************
**
** That's weird, looking at this drop sequence, it looks like
** you would miss the island...
** You know that you're cruising at 3000m and that the island is 1000m
** directly northwest from the jump site, with winds blowing with you
** You decide to fix the code to ensure you'll land safely.
